Given the data from the Seattle database, there were many options available to pursue. At first I wanted to see if accident severity increased with poor weather and 
low-light settings. After I went through the data in Jupyter Notebooks, I decided to focus strictly on the light environment of the accident. I believe that there 
will be more accidents during the day than at night/dusk/low light because of the increased people commuting to and from work.

With this information stakeholders can make more of an informed decision on where to put funds for certain projects. For example, if Seattle was deciding to put
up more street lights or to reduce traffic in congested areas, the city can make the better choice.

Most of the data provided in the data set will not be needed. My first step is to clean the data set so I can get an idea of which parts I will need.
In this set I will use the severity code column and the light condition column to get a better understanding of accidents occur within that category. I will 
hopefully be able to compare the light setting with accident severity and find connections between the two. I plan on plotting the data I find to allow for better visual
understanding.
